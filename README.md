# Guardian Science Reader

This is an Android app which fetches science and technology stories from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com) and displays them to the user.  It also allows the user to open a web browser to read a given article.

The app is designed to showcase core Android development skills, including:
* Making asynchronous API calls using a Loader
* Parsing a JSON response from a server
* Populating an AdapterView with fetched information at runtime
* Using a two-pane list/detail layout for tablets

This app was created by a Udacity employee during the development of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree program.  You *may not use code from this app in a Udacity submission*.

## Note

For a functioning app, you must supply your own API key.  Place your key in a text file titled `api_key.txt` in `app/src/main/res/raw`.
